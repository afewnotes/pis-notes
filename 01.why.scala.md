# Why

>- name stands for 'scalable language', can apply to a wide range of programming tasks, from writing small scripts to building large systems
>- runs on the standard Java platform
>- a blend of object-oriented and functional programming concepts in a statically typed language
>- Associative maps

```scala
    var t = Map("a" -> 1, "b" -> 2)
    t += ("c" -> 3)
    println(t("a"))
```

>- Scala allows users to grow and adapt the language in the directions they need by defining easy-to-use libraries that feel like native language support.

```scala
    def factorial(x: BigInt): BigInt =
        if (x == 0) 1 else x * factorial(x - 1)
```

>- Akka, a Scala API for "actor-based" concurrent programming
